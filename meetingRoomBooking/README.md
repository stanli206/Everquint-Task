# Meeting Room Booking Service

This project is a backend service for managing meeting rooms and bookings.
It is implemented as part of an interview assignment to demonstrate clean API design,
business rule validation, idempotency handling, concurrency awareness, and reporting.

The service is built using **Node.js, Express, and MongoDB** and follows a layered
architecture for better readability and maintainability.

## 📌 Features Overview

* Create and list meeting rooms
* Create bookings with strict business rules
* Prevent overlapping bookings for the same room
* Support idempotent booking creation using `Idempotency-Key`
* Cancel bookings with a 1-hour grace period
* Generate room utilization reports
* Clear validation and error handling
* Beginner-readable but industry-standard structure

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack

* **Backend**: Node.js, Express
* **Database**: MongoDB (Mongoose)
* **Runtime**: Node.js (ES Modules)
* **Dev Tools**: Nodemon
* **Testing**: Jest

  "capacity": 10,
  "floor": 2,
  "amenities": ["Projector", "Whiteboard"]
}
```

Rules:

* Room name must be unique (case-insensitive)
* Capacity must be >= 1

---

#### List Rooms

```
GET /rooms
```

Optional Query Params:

* `minCapacity`
* `amenity`

---

### 📅 Bookings

#### Create Booking

```
POST /bookings
```

Headers:

```
Idempotency-Key: unique-key-123
```

Body:

```json
{
  "roomId": "<ROOM_ID>",
  "title": "Team Meeting",
  "organizerEmail": "user@example.com",
  "startTime": "2025-01-06T10:00:00",
  "endTime": "2025-01-06T12:00:00"
}
```

Business Rules:

* `startTime < endTime`
* Duration: 15 minutes to 4 hours
* Allowed only Mon–Fri, 08:00–20:00
* No overlapping confirmed bookings
* Duplicate requests with same Idempotency-Key return same booking

---

#### List Bookings

```
GET /bookings
```

Query Params:

* `roomId`
* `from`
* `to`
* `limit`
* `offset`

---

#### Cancel Booking

```
POST /bookings/{id}/cancel
```

Rules:

* Can be cancelled only up to 1 hour before startTime
* Cancelling an already cancelled booking returns same booking
* Cancelled bookings do not block new bookings

---

### 📊 Reports
